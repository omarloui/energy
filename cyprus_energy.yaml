task_description: >
  This dataset is designed for fine-tuning a smart home energy assistant.
  The model will predict a single smart home's energy consumption and solar generation in Cyprus using fixed numerical values and calculated metrics.
  These examples help the LLM generate detailed, mathematically-informed responses including cost coverage, net cost, self-sufficiency, and savings.
  The goal is to assist users in understanding how solar energy generation offsets their electricity consumption and to provide actionable recommendations for energy savings.

  - question: "What are the predicted energy metrics for my smart home on a holiday?"
    answer: "On a holiday, your smart home is expected to consume 650 kWh, with a corresponding solar generation of 480 kWh."
  - question: "How do I calculate if my solar generation covers my energy costs?"
    answer: "To determine if your solar generation covers your energy costs, compare your predicted consumption of 18 kWh with your solar generation of 12 kWh. Using an energy tariff of 0.15 €/kWh, the shortfall of 6 kWh results in a daily cost of 0.90 €."
  - question: "Would the cost be covered by our generation?"
    answer: "Based on current predictions, your home consumes 18 kWh today while generating 12 kWh from solar panels. This yields a coverage of about 66.7%. Since this is below 100%, your generation does not fully cover your consumption, and additional power or energy-saving measures might be needed."
  - question: "How would you calculate the net energy cost for my home today?"
    answer: "To calculate your net energy cost, subtract your solar generation (12 kWh) from your total consumption (18 kWh) to get a net consumption of 6 kWh. Multiplying this by your energy rate of 0.15 €/kWh results in a net cost of 0.90 €."
  - question: "How do I determine my home's solar self-sufficiency ratio?"
    answer: "Your solar self-sufficiency ratio is calculated by dividing your solar generation (12 kWh) by your total energy consumption (18 kWh) and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. This gives you a ratio of approximately 66.7%, indicating the proportion of your energy needs met by solar power."
  - question: "How much will I save on my electric bill if my solar generation exceeds my consumption?"
    answer: "If your solar generation were to increase to 20 kWh while your consumption remains at 18 kWh, the surplus of 2 kWh at an energy rate of 0.15 €/kWh would save you about 0.30 € on your bill today."
  - question: "What is my net energy balance for today?"
    answer: "By subtracting your solar generation (12 kWh) from your total consumption (18 kWh), your net energy balance for today is a deficit of 6 kWh."
  - question: "How does my energy consumption today compare with yesterday's consumption?"
    answer: "Based on recent data, your home consumed 18 kWh today compared to 17 kWh yesterday, indicating a slight increase of 1 kWh."
  - question: "What is the forecasted surplus energy for my home today?"
    answer: "If your solar panels were to generate 20 kWh today while your consumption remains at 18 kWh, you would have a surplus of 2 kWh."
  - question: "How much can I reduce my energy cost if I reduce consumption by 10%?"
    answer: "A 10% reduction in your 18 kWh consumption would lower your usage by 1.8 kWh, saving approximately 0.27 € daily at a rate of 0.15 €/kWh."
  - question: "What are some actionable recommendations to improve my home's energy efficiency?"
    answer: "To enhance efficiency, consider upgrading to LED lighting, installing a smart thermostat, and scheduling high-consumption appliances during off-peak hours. These measures could reduce your energy usage by up to 10%."
  - question: "How does my current energy usage compare with my monthly average?"
    answer: "Today's usage of 18 kWh is slightly below your monthly average of 20 kWh per day, suggesting an opportunity to maintain lower consumption with consistent habits."
  - question: "What is the projected cost saving if my solar panels perform at maximum efficiency today?"
    answer: "If your solar generation increased to 20 kWh from today's predicted 12 kWh, you would cover your entire consumption and even produce a surplus, potentially saving up to 1.20 € daily at a tariff of 0.15 €/kWh."
  - question: "How does the forecasted solar generation today compare with last week?"
    answer: "Today's solar generation is forecast to be 12 kWh, which is 2 kWh lower than last week's average of 14 kWh, likely due to less optimal weather conditions."
  - question: "What are my predicted energy costs for today and tomorrow combined?"
    answer: "For today, your net cost is 0.90 € (6 kWh deficit at 0.15 €/kWh). If tomorrow's predictions are similar, the combined cost would be approximately 1.80 €."
  - question: "What is my energy efficiency rating based on today's consumption and solar generation?"
    answer: "With a consumption of 18 kWh and solar generation of 12 kWh, your efficiency rating is around 66.7%. Improving your self-sufficiency above 80% is recommended for optimal cost savings."
  - question: "What are my energy usage trends over the past week, and how do they compare with tomorrow's forecast?"
    answer: "Over the past week, your average daily consumption was around 18 kWh, and tomorrow's forecast is 19 kWh, indicating a slight upward trend that may require attention if it persists."
  - question: "How much energy do I need to generate to be completely self-sufficient today?"
    answer: "To be completely self-sufficient with a consumption of 18 kWh, your solar panels need to generate at least 18 kWh. At the current forecast of 12 kWh, an additional 6 kWh of generation is required."
  - question: "What is the forecasted energy cost for my home this month?"
    answer: "Based on a predicted monthly consumption of 600 kWh and an average tariff of 0.15 €/kWh, your monthly energy cost is projected to be 90 €."
  - question: "How do external temperature variations affect my home's energy consumption?"
    answer: "During extreme summer heat, your consumption can increase by approximately 7 kWh per day compared to mild conditions, while in winter, colder temperatures may add an extra 4 kWh per day for heating."
  - question: "What is the impact of cloudy days on my solar generation?"
    answer: "On cloudy days, solar generation can drop by up to 40%. For example, if a sunny day typically produces 18 kWh, a cloudy day might only yield around 11 kWh due to increased cloud coverage."
  - question: "How does my predicted energy consumption compare to my historical average?"
    answer: "Historically, your home has averaged 18 kWh per day. The current forecast aligns closely with this average, indicating stable usage trends over time."
  - question: "What additional measures can I implement to improve solar coverage?"
    answer: "Improving solar panel maintenance, reducing shading, and optimizing panel angles could boost generation by an estimated 10-15%, potentially increasing output from 12 kWh to around 14 kWh per day."
  - question: "How much extra energy generation is required to achieve self-sufficiency?"
    answer: "To be fully self-sufficient with a consumption of 18 kWh per day, you would need an additional 6 kWh of solar generation beyond the current forecast of 12 kWh."
  - question: "What is the projected improvement in energy efficiency if I upgrade my appliances?"
    answer: "Upgrading to energy-efficient appliances could reduce your consumption by approximately 10%, lowering daily usage from 18 kWh to about 16 kWh."
  - question: "How do weather trends in Kyrenia influence my home's energy forecasting?"
    answer: "Kyrenia's weather trends—characterized by high summer temperatures, ample sunshine, and low cloud coverage in summer versus cooler, wetter winters with higher cloud coverage—directly impact your solar generation and energy consumption. For instance, lower cloud coverage in summer allows your 6kW solar system to produce closer to 20 kWh on sunny days, while higher cloud coverage in winter may reduce output to around 12 kWh, affecting your overall energy balance."
